This non-uniform implementation is base on one private article from [Oleg Kiselyov](http://okmij.org/ftp/). 

## files

  * Files ***nonnifeval2.hs*** and ***nonnifeval3.hs***  are non-uniform versions of *feval2.hs* and *feval3.hs*.
  * ***nonnifeval42.hs*** is a transition version between *feval3* and *feval4*.
  * ***nonnifeval4.hs*** corresponds to *feval4.hs* and is the final version.
