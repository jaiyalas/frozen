# mulLL

This repository contains two implementations of *derived compiler and VM for multi-level language*: 

* **non-uniform version** (base on paper [Deriving Compilers and Virtual Machines for a Multi-Level Language](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-76637-7_14))
* **an uniform version** (base on article [Deriving Non-uniform code-generating Staged VM](http://okmij.org/ftp/ML/StagedVM-nonU.ml)). 

The whole deriving process is shown in [here (slideshare)](http://www.slideshare.net/YunYanChi/deriving-a-compiler-and-interpreter-for-a-multilevel).
